The dataset requires application to the relevant institutions, so we are unable to provide a specific case. You can apply for the use of the dataset from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and South China University of Technology. To facilitate running the program, we have provided the extraction program for the SCUT-COUCH2009 dataset in the read_dat.py file, which retains each Chinese character sample as a .txt file. Afterward, you can run the run.py file.

If you find our work helpful, please cite our paper: Online Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition Based on 1-D Convolution and Two-Streams Transformers. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 2023.
We are very grateful to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and South China University of Technology for providing the dataset, and to Dr. Gan Ji for his help.
